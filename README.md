# DBLingo

DBLingo is an interactive, Duolingo-style game for learning MongoDB by doing. Players select a learning path, complete short hands-on lessons, and practice MongoDB concepts through domain-specific or value-proposition levels, stages, and challenges.

## What is included

- **Learning paths** with proprietary examples for each domain, plus competitive value-proposition tracks.
- **Stage-based exercises** that teach MongoDB document modeling, querying, aggregation, indexing, and Atlas concepts.
- **Gamified progression** with XP, streaks, leaves, level completion, and challenge screens.
- **Static web deployment** that runs directly from GitHub Pages.

## Learning paths

DBLingo includes content packs for:

- General MongoDB learning
- MongoDB vs Postgres value proposition
- Manufacturing
- Financial Services
- Cybersecurity
- Healthcare
- Retail
- Telecom
- Insurance
- Media
- Gaming

Each industry or value-proposition path has its own `data.jsx` content pack so stages and levels can use relevant examples instead of sharing one generic dataset everywhere.

## Run locally

Because this is a static React/Babel prototype, you can open `index.html` directly in a browser.

For a local web server, run:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then open:

```text
http://localhost:8000
```

## Deploy with GitHub Pages

This repository is ready for GitHub Pages deployment from the root of the `main` branch.

Deployment checklist:

1. Push the repository to GitHub.
2. Open the repository settings.
3. Go to **Pages**.
4. Set the source to **Deploy from a branch**.
5. Select branch `main` and folder `/root`.
6. Save.

The `.nojekyll` file is included so GitHub Pages serves all static assets without Jekyll processing.
